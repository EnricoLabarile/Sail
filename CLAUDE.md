# Vento e Vele (Godot) — notes for Claude Code

- **Reply to Enrico in Italian.** All text inside the game stays in English.
- The remake in Godot 4.7 (Standard, GDScript, Compatibility renderer) of the HTML prototype in
  `EnricoLabarile/Sail---Prototype` (its `index.html` and `CLAUDE.md` describe the game; its `docs/godot-plan.md`
  is the plan: 2D world with a few simple 3D models like the boat, phone held upright, phases 0–10).
- Enrico works in the editor on Windows and commits with GitHub Desktop: if he says he changed something, pull first.
  Commit after every working change, short messages in English, and push to `main`.
- **Every push to `main` builds the web export and publishes it** on https://enricolabarile.github.io/Sail/
  (`.github/workflows/web.yml`, preset "Web" in `export_presets.cfg`, no threads so it runs on Pages; Godot and the
  templates' version in `GODOT_VERSION` must match the editor). That's how Enrico plays it on his Android phone.
- Phone layout: viewport 360×800, stretch `canvas_items` / `expand`, portrait, Nearest texture filter, touch
  emulated from the mouse. Leave a gap at the bottom of the screen for the navigation bar.
- Check a change without the editor: `godot --headless --path . --import` then `--quit-after 30` for script errors.
